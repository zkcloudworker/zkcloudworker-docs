# Introduction to zkCloudWorker

![zkCloudWorker](/img/zkCloudWorker.png)

In the fast-paced realm of ZK proving, zkCloudWorker stands out as a potential game-changer for both zkApp developers and users.

By delivering ultra-fast proving in the cloud, along with robust isolation, composability, and an excellent user experience (UX), zkCloudWorker has the potential to significantly streamline and expedite the development of MINA zkApps both on web and mobile devices.

Instead of downloading 1 GB of proving keys, compiling, and performing proofs on a web or mobile worker, a simple API call can be made to the powerful zkCloudWorker to launch a worker in the cloud. This offers ample memory, CPU power, and parallel processing capabilities for recursive proof calculations.

Privacy is maintained through the isolation of processes, encryption of all data, and the ability to process private data on the web using technologies like hashing and Merkle Tree calculations. Preprocessed data is then sent to the cloud worker.

This opens doors for a diverse range of Web2 developers to seamlessly enter the exciting world of the MINA protocol and o1js.

According to our POC tests, with zkCloudWorker, the speed of the calculations can be as much as 5 to 10 times faster (seconds instead of minutes), and the memory requirements can be 10 times lower.

With more than 22 thousand active open-source developers that contribute to crypto and the Mina ecosystem being the second fastest growing ecosystem by the number of full-time developers, we expect the demand for cloud-proving services to rise significantly in the future.

The market is already actively moving in the direction of cloud proving. The Nil Foundation has raised $22 million to build proof market in a round led by Polychain Capital with the participation of other investors, including Blockchain Capital, Starkware, and Mina Protocol.
